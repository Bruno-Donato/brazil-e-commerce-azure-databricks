In this project we will be using some ETL, analytics and BI tools on Microsoft Azure cloud in the company of Databricks and Power Bi. We will use the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_geolocation_dataset.csv) to create a relational database for analysis.

The Microsoft Azure platform was used to create the necessary infrastructure because I believe it offers a better connection with Databricks and Power Bi. The following Azure tools and others were used:

- **Data Factory**: Used for the ingestion of the raw data that you can find in this repository
- **Data Lake Gen 2**: 
- **Synapse**: 
- **Databricks**: 
- **Data Factory**: 
- **Power Bi**:
